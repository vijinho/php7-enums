If you want to give me some feedback or make a suggestion, create an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/vijinho/php7-enums/issues/new).

If you want to get your hands dirty, great! Here's a couple of
steps/guidelines:

- Add tests for your changes (in `tests/`).
- Remember to stick to the existing code style as best as possible. When in
  doubt, follow `PSR-2`.
- Before investing a lot of time coding, create an issue to get our opinion on
  your big changes.
- Update the documentation, if applicable.
